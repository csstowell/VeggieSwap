# About

VeggieSwap is a full stack web application for swapping excess produce locally. This application allows users to store information and view other local growers in their neighborhood. I was motivated to make this project because I wanted a way to exchange/swap excess produce with local neighbors and the community in a more engaging and efficient way.



# Features
Each user can register and login to view their personal profile. Users can quickly search a list of produce names and add the produce along with a quantity or optional note to their profile.  From the profile, users can choose to exchange produce by clicking the exchange button where they can then specify an amount and add optional comments. On the exchange page, users can filter by distance in order to see a list of exchange produce results within that radius. Finally, users can then choose to contact the user who posted the exchange by selecting the email icon which then prompts a message that will send to that user.
